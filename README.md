# Flight-Planner--Python-Console-App-

The aim of this application was to create an object orientated software program designed to dynamically provide travel & flight information to the user. 
By inputting an aircraft’s or airport’s identification, the program will return the stored information of that object to the user.
The user may also plan a route using the application. This is carried out by inputting the airport code for each destination
as well as the aircraft code for the plane carrying out the journey. The program will then simulate the aircrafts journey to each 
airport and account for its range and fuel capabilities. This functionality is carried out by two different menu functions. 
The user has the option to find the shortest flight route for a given number of destinations.
Separately, the user can then input a flight plan into the system. The program will then return the total distance traveled and 
the total cost in euro of the journey the user has input in the order given. 
All of this is achieved through a command-line interface accessed through the UserInterface.py file.
